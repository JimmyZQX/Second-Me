    ENTITY_EXTRACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """# **Task Overview**:
To build a personal encyclopedia named "Personal Wiki" exclusively for {userName}, extracting meaningful entities from daily notes and conversations. 
Focus on identifying personalized nouns that: 
1. Nouns that recur in user-generated content; 
2. Hold unique personal significance compared to general population; 
3. Carry user-specific memories or emotional connections. Strictly filter out generic entities lacking personalization attributes, with an enhanced emphasis on extracting names of people related to {userName} (e.g., friends, colleagues, family members, etc.), professional terms, high-frequency words, etc.

## 1.Perspective Setting:
* Always describe entities from {userName}'s perspective, using {userName} as the third-person subject in all descriptions.
* Clearly distinguish between {userName}'s perspective and other users' experiences when mentioned.

## 2.Entity Analysis:
* Analyze the text thoroughly, focusing on explicit and implicit references to people, objects, and events.
* Highlight how these entities influence {userName}'s worldview, beliefs, professional activities, or personal life.
* Include only entities that directly impact, challenge, or align with {userName}'s core values, experiences, or goals.

## 3.Extraction Strategy:
* Extract entities highly relevant to {userName}, considering both professional and daily-life contexts.
* Avoid generic or irrelevant entities unless they are crucial to understanding {userName}'s cognitive or emotional changes.
* Only extract entities contained in the original notes, avoiding summarizing new nouns.Focus on physical nouns and people rather than abstract concepts.

## 4.Entity Structure:

Each entity should include:
* Entity Name: The name of the entity as it appears in the record.
* Entity Type: The type of the entity (from {entity_types}).
* Entity Description: Capture {userName}'s impression of the entity in {prefer_lang}, emphasizing its relevance to {userName}'s background and experiences.
* Create Time: The timestamp of the note or conversation where the entity appears.
* Note Id: The Note Id of the note supplied by the origin information, if there's no note Id, then it should be ''.
* Session Id: The Session Id of the conversation supplied by the origin information, if there's no session Id, then it should be ''.

## 5.Output Specifications:
* Use {prefer_lang} for all descriptions but do not translate {userName}'s name.
* Ensure clarity in describing each entity, maintaining a professional yet accessible tone, and avoid overly complicated or casual expressions.
* For each extracted entity, show the note id or session id and the create time of the origin note it was extracted from, so follow-up processes can clearly find the relationship with the entity and the note or conversations. For entities extracted from multiple notes, list all notes containing the entity.
* Focus solely on entities relevant to {userName}, avoiding generic or unrelated ones unless their inclusion is critical to understanding {userName}'s emotional or cognitive transformation.

## 6.Special Notes: 
* Exclude entities that lack meaningful connections to {userName}'s background or experiences.
* Contextual relevance is key; avoid including frequently mentioned entities if they have no tangible link to {userName}'s personal or professional life.

Analyze the record in depth, concentrating on explicit and implicit references to people and objects. Pay particular attention to how {userName} interacts with, perceives, and is influenced by these entities. Track {userName}'s cognitive responses (e.g., changes in thinking or perspective) and emotional shifts, especially as they relate to specific people, relationships, and physical objects.

2. Record Content Analysis (Focus on Entities):
Analyze the record in depth, concentrating on explicit and implicit references to people and objects. Pay particular attention to how {userName} interacts with, and is influenced by these entities. Try to get the facts straight, focus more on the relationship and experience instead of making emotional assumptions.
Focus on how these entities shape {userName}'s worldview, beliefs, or professional activities. Highlight relationships with significant individuals and meaningful objects that play a role in the user's personal or professional life. Only include entities that directly impact, challenge, or align with {userName}'s core values, experiences, or goals.

Only entities that are directly tied to {userName}'s professional life, daily life, interpersonal relationship  should be extracted. Only the entities contained in the origin notes should be extracted, DO NOT try to summary new nouns by yourself. Focus on physical nouns and people rather than conceptual or abstract ones. 
4. Entity Extraction and Description:
Entity Structure:
Entity Name: The name of the entity (as it appears in the record).
Entity Type: The type of the entity (from {entity_types}).
Entity Description: Capture {userName}'s impression of the entity in {prefer_lang}, while emphasizing its relevance to {userName}'s background and experiences.
Create time: The create time of the note supplied by the origin information.
Note Id: The Note Id of the note supplied by the origin information, if there's no note Id, only a session Id exists, then the note Id should be ''
Session Id: The Session Id of the conversation supplied by the origin information, if there's no session Id, only a note Id, then the session Id should be ''
If the entity influences {userName}'s thinking or work (e.g., an author, concept, or person), highlight how this entity directly impacts {userName}'s professional, personal, or intellectual life.
Avoid including descriptions of entities that are generic or unrelated to the user unless they directly help clarify something important about {userName}'s experience.
5. Output Guidelines:
Use {prefer_lang} for all descriptions, ensuring that {userName}'s perspective remains consistent in the third person, with natural, concise, and clear expressions, don't simply use his/her instead.
Begin with key observations from {userName}'s perspective, followed by relevant details that explain the connection between the entity and {userName}'s professional/personal experiences.
Ensure clarity in how each entity is described, maintaining a professional yet accessible tone, and avoid overly complicated or casual expressions.
Focus solely on entities that are relevant to {userName}, and avoid extracting generic or unrelated ones unless their inclusion is critical to understanding {userName}'s emotional or cognitive transformation.
Special Notes:
Do not extract entities that do not meaningfully relate to {userName}'s background, or experiences. This means entities like generic concepts or figures that do not connect with {userName}'s profession or daily life should be excluded.
Contextual relevance is key: Even if an entity appears frequently in the record, if it has no tangible link to {userName}'s personal or professional life, it should not be included.

Below is a set of data that objectively explains the events that occurred at different times between this concept and user. 
The content may include the definition of user and user's views on concept [{entity_name}] or events that occurred. Now you need to focus on the description of the concept [{entity_name}]. 
Generate a document that introduces the concept [{entity_name}] to user from a second-person perspective. You should follow these steps to complete this task

1. ** Analysis and reasoning **
- Identify the primary and secondary of each content. 
- The focus of this generation task is on the concept [{entity_name}] and its relationship with user. 
- It is not necessary to generate the definition of user itself in the document. 
- Carefully analyze the content of the provided description list to form a thorough and multidimensional understanding of the mentioned concept or concept group.

2.** Review previous version document of {entity_name} **: 
Based on the previous version document of {entity_name}, review the newly provided description information and think about the scope of the new description information. Carefully adjust on the previous version of the document.

Preview Version Document of {entity_name}:

    TIMELINE_GENERATE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an insightful and intelligent assistant. Your current task is to organize a detailed and accurate evolution timeline for a specific entity. 
The user will provide information about the entity, including the entity's name and raw data extracted from various sources at different time points. 

Each piece of raw data is structured as follows:  ["CreateTime"]["SourceID"] "EntityDesc"
- "CreateTime" indicates the creation time of the raw data, reflecting the state or events experienced by the entity at that time.
- "SourceID" is a unique identifier for the source of the raw data
- "EntityDesc" describes specific matters related to the entity, all are extracted from the user's memory and may represent the user's views on the entity, as well as the user's interaction events with the entity.

Here are User Info:
{user_self_intro}

Your task is to complete the following steps:
1. First you to carefully read and deeply understand this information
2. Then try to explore the development history of the entity from the information of these entities
    - The development history of the relationship between the entity and user is recorded with each month as a single item, covering important events the entity participated in during that month, including origins, developments, turning points, major events, etc.
    - Each item should retain specific details as well as information about the time of occurrence.

3. Finally, organize it into a complete timeline
  - Organize the relationship between the entity and user's timeline based on the above development history, select requiring a clear development context, accurate event descriptions, specific details, arrange in reverse chronological order.
  - Remove the content in the Description that already exists in User Info to avoid information redundancy.
  - The description should not contain excessive user information; it should only describe the events related to the relationship between the user and the entity.
  - Do not use Entity as the subject; instead, adopt an objective perspective to introduce the events between the user and the Entity.
  Such as: xxxx, A xxx mention B xxx or xxx, A xxx with B xxx, A xxx said: B xxxx, and so on.
  - The description that defines an entity is the user's view or determination of that entity, maybe you can selectively add the relevant information, such as: A think that B is XXXXX.
  - Each description should be followed by the source information [source ID] that the description referenced.
  - Replace {user_name} in the description with "you" to reduce the sense of unfamiliarity with the user.

Output Format:

** YYYY-MM ** [Split by month]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] (Event Description, Attempt merge same day's events) [SourceID]
...

** YYYY-MM **
...

...


Do not use words like "possibly", "maybe" in the description, The information within the timeline should be certain and definite.
Please compile a complete and clear evolution timeline for the relationship between the entity and user.

    You are a neutral and objective timeline compiler. Your role is to create a clear and concise timeline of the user({user_name})'s interactions with a specific entity {entity_name} based on their daily timelines. The focus should be on presenting the facts of the user's relationship with the entity in a straightforward manner, without adding unnecessary analysis or subjective interpretations.

** User Info:**
{user_self_intro}

** Your Task:**

1. ** Information Processing:**
   - Read the user's notes carefully and extract the key details about their interactions with the entity.
   - Do not make assumptions or draw conclusions beyond what is explicitly stated in the notes.

2. ** Timeline Creation:**
   - Organize the interactions by month, with each month as a separate section. 
   - For each day within a month, combine any similar or related interactions into a single entry. Only create separate entries for the same day if the content is significantly different.
   - You only need to extract information related to the entity {entity_name} and avoid other noise, and use the second person perspective to describe the user's actions and experiences with the entity. For example, "You used [entity] to...", "You encountered [entity] at...".
   - If you cannot extract entity-related information from the daily timeline, you can ignore the daily timeline instead of forcibly extracting it.
   - Avoid including any redundant information that is already present in the User Info section.
   - The timeline should be written in a simple and direct style, focusing on the user's objective experiences with the entity.

** Output Format:**
```
** YYYY-MM ** [Split by month]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] (Brief description of the interaction with the entity) [SourceID, number only]
...
** YYYY-MM **
...
```

** Guidelines:**

- Keep the descriptions short and to the point. Do not include any unnecessary details or elaborations.
- Use various expression techniques to make the output more natural and concise.
- Ensure that the timeline is easy to read and understand, with a clear chronological order.
- If there are multiple interactions on the same day, merge them into one entry unless they are about completely different aspects of the user's relationship with the entity.
- Write the timeline in {prefer_lang}.
